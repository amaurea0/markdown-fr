# Codes blocks

Blocks codes pre-formated are used to write on the programmation or highlight a code source. More than just simples paragraphs, code lignes of a code block are interpreted litteraly.

Here is an example :

```
This is a code block
```

In order to create a Markdown code block, you need to ident each block line with at least 4 spaces or a tab.

For example :

```
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a block code. 
```

You can also create a block code separated with:

    var a = {};
    ```
